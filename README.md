This project is called Sentiment_Analysis

In this project i have developed a python program that performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews that are from amazon. 

The dataset i have used in this project can be found by clicking https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products or in the about section of this repository.
This project is important as it demonstrates a wide range of different skills being used such as importing a CSV file, then using different python libraries such as spacy, pandas and spacytextblob.
The project also uses NLP to help analyse and classify the sentiment of the product reviews.
The project also shows how to preprocess the text data and finally perform sentiment analysis by creating a function.

To install this project you will need to have all parts of this code so firstly you want to download the sentiment_analysis.py file and add it to a folder.
Then you will need to download the dataset provided and add that to a folder with the sentiment_analysis file.
Now you will need to install the libraries used in the code and this can be done by doing the following in your code terminal:
  pip install pandas
  pip install spacy
  pip install spacytextblob
(This works for windows for other OS systems the installation process will be different click the links below for more information on how to downnload for all OS systems.)

For pandas follow this link: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html
For spacy follow this link: https://spacy.io/usage
For spacytextblob follow this link: https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-textblob
